<!--HTML: HyperText Markup Language: 
	THis is technically not a programming language - because HTML is just
	used to structure a webpage, and it doesn't provide functionality.
	HTML docuemtns are files that end with .html or .htm extension.
	Once we create our webpage and launch, a web browser will read the html
	file and render its contents frmo top to bottom
	
	Difference between an element and a tag:
	Element: an element is everying from the staring tag, the contents, and the 
	closing tag
	The tag is just referring to the <>
