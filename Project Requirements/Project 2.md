Project 2 is a group project. Groups will range in size from 3 to 4 people.

Requirements
============

1) You are to build whatever type of fullstack application you want.
	* BUT No video games/games of any sort!

2) Your group's idea must be approved by me before you start writing the application.
	* You **MUST** provide me with your group's name, the name of your application and a high-level description of it, and a list of the features you are
	  attempting to complete. When I say "high-level description", I mean that you should provide a summary paragraph of your application. It should
	  sound like a sales pitch in which you introduce your application and briefly sell its functionality to the listener. This is the description that
	  clients will see on your portfolio, so make it good! Do NOT forget to do this and send me the the description.

Technology Requirements
=======================

1) HTML/CSS
2) JavaScript
3) React
4) The application must use a cloud database (e.g. RDS). If your application supports uploading files, you should use an S3 bucket.
5) Spring (backend)
	* You can use pure Spring Web.
	* Or you can use Spring Data JPA with Spring Boot.
6) Must test your application. I require 50 tests.
	* Must use Mockito where appropriate.
	* Must write some tests using Jest.

Tips:

- Please use Git (responsibly)
- Please use feature branches and delete the feature branches when they've been merged in
- Code reviews (look at each other's code)
- Implement a code freeze (please don't push 30 minutes before you present)
- Communicate with each other
- Use TDD
- Write good user stories
- Use task management tool such as Trello, Asana, Jira, Github Project Boards
- Daily standups (meet with your group and discuss the progress you have made on your user stories)
