## Grading Calculator Activity

Let's make a simple grading calculator. 

Below is an array with 5 scores: Math, English, Science, History, and Art, respectively. 

int [] arr = {95, 85, 62, 40, 79}; <br />
(Copy this array into your main method) 


Write a program that converts the score into a letter grade. Be sure to print the subject beside the score so the student knows what each grade is for!

Grading scale: <br />
A: between 90 - 100 <br />
B: between 80 - 89 <br />
C: between 70 - 79 <br />
D: betwene 60 - 69 <br />
F: 59 and under


Example output: 
Printed to console: 
Math: A
English: B
Science: D
