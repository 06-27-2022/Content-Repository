# Summing Numbers
---

## Instructions

Given an array of numbers of type int, write a method that returns the sum of all of the numbers in the array. Note that:

1. Your solution should contain a method other than the main method; you are writing a custom method.
2. Your method must return a value; it cannot simply print the answer to the console.

## Sample Data

Your solution should be able to accommodate for an array of any size. Here are some examples of the numbers that could be passed to your method:

- {3, 4, 332, 4, 3, 222, 402, 8392, 83, 2, 1, 244, 5, 4, 33, 842, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 0, 8871, 3, 1, 7, 9, 900, 1, 19, 23, 98, 89, 733, 437, 87, 98}

- {}

- {3, 2, 3}

- {1}
